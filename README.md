# Crop Prediction App

## Overview

The Crop Prediction App is designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in predicting the best crops to plant based on environmental factors such as phosphorus levels, nitrogen levels, humidity, temperature, and rainfall. Using advanced algorithms, the app analyzes input data and provides crop recommendations to optimize yield and sustainability.

## Features

- Input parameters for phosphorus, nitrogen, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
- Predicts suitable crops based on the provided conditions.
- User-friendly interface to easily input data and view predictions.
- Built with robust algorithms to ensure accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Machine Learning libraries(  Scikit-learn)
- Flask 
- Pandas / NumPy (for data manipulation)
